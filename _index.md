Hey,

I'm Murray Groves, a Python developer who is learning C++.

I've been interested in programming since I was 10, when I went to a coding club in my primary school. That club got me into programming and ever since programming has been one of my main hobbies.

## Scouts
<p style="margin: auto">I've been a Scout since I was 9, I've always enjoyed working with other people and Scouts taught me to be a great leader. When I turned 15, I was too old to stay in Scouts but I wanted to put something back into the community that had been a key part of my childhood. This is why I started volunteering every Tuesday night to help run sessions and give young children opportunities to do activities that would never normally be possible in such an urban environment.</p>

Once I left my primary school I started to volunteer at the club to put back what I got given, I volunteered for 4 years before it closed down because the teacher who ran it got a new job. I've also been a part of the Scouting association for 6 years and once I left due to age I decided to volunteer as a young leader to help children get to experience things that they wouldn't normally have the chance to do in London.
