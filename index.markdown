Hi, I'm Murray. I'm currently studying Computer Science at University of Bristol.

I love programming (usually in Python/Rust). Most of my projects utilise third-party APIs such as the [Discord](https://discord.com) API.
I'm very interested in cryptocurrency and I've even [made my own](/crypto/python/2021/05/19/murraxcoin.html)!

Check out my other projects [here](/portfolio.html)

## Soft Skills Experience
### Scouting
I was a Scout from 9 years old, I've always enjoyed working with other people and Scouts taught me to be a great leader.  
When I turned 15, I was too old to stay in Scouts but I wanted to put something back into the community that had been a key part of my childhood.  
This is why I volunteered every week to help run sessions and give young children opportunities to do activities that would never normally be possible in the urban environment of London.

#### Daniel Sheehan - Group Scout Leader, 9th Muswell Hill
> Murray has so far completed over a years volunteering with the 9th Muswell Hill Scout Group in the role of a young leader.  
During this time he has attended regularly and been a significant support to the leadership team.  
He has engaged well with the young people running activities games and planning sessions during this time.  
Furthermore he has attended camps and introduced a new communication system into the group off his own back to aid our administration.  
It has been a pleasure to work with Murray during his time with us. 

### Coding Club
When I left my primary school I wanted to give other children the experience that I had gained in the school Coding Club.  
This is why I helped out every Thursday for four years, until the teacher who ran the club left the school.  
This time taught me many leadership qualities and has made me very resilient and patient due to teaching young children.
