<!-- excerpt-start -->
Oracle is a Discord bot for a [Welcome to Nightvale](https://welcometonightvale.com) Discord server I'm in.  
<!-- excerpt-end -->

It has a few basic features:
- Respond to user-defined triggers with a pre-defined response.
- View existing triggers
- Remove triggers
- View a random trigger and response as the bot's status
- Send a message when a new episode of a specific podcast comes out

### Testimonials
#### Princesslovepink#8733
> I love being able to make it say weird Nightvale stuff! It really fits into the theme of the server!

#### Fell.EXE#3777
>The developer regularly maintains and improves upon the bot to match the needs and requirements of its userbase.

#### floatingcat#9476
>Oracle has been great fun, especially when it chimes in unexpectedly during a conversation when someone happens to say one of its prompts! It's like our server pet, fantastic idea for a bot.
