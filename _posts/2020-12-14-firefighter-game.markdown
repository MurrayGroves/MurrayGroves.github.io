<!-- excerpt-start -->
For my Computer Science Game Design coursework, I had to design and develop an educational game in [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)/[P5.play](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/).
<!-- excerpt-end -->

In the game, you have to solve arithmetic problems to put out fires in an apartment building and earn points.  

You can play it [here](https://murraygrov.es/Firefighter-Game/)
