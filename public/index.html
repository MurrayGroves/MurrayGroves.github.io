<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hey,

I'm Murray Groves, a Python developer who is learning C++.

I've been programming since I was 10, when I went to a coding club in my primary school. That club got me into programming and ever since programming has been one of my main hobbies.</p>

<h2>Scouts</h2>
<p>I've been a Scout since I was 9, I've always enjoyed working with other people and Scouts taught me to be a great leader. When I turned 15, I was too old to stay in Scouts but I wanted to put something back into the community that had been a key part of my childhood. This is why I started volunteering every Tuesday night to help run sessions and give young children opportunities to do activities that would never normally be possible in such an urban environment.</p>

  <blockquote class="testimonial-text">Murray has so far completed over a years volunteering with the Tuesday Scout Troop at 9th Muswell Hill Scout Group in the role of a young leader.
<br/><br/>
During this time he has attended regularly and been a significant support to the leadership team.
<br/><br/>
He has engaged well with the young people running activities games and planning session during this time.
<br/><br/>
Furthermore he has attended camps and introduced a new communication system into the group off his own back to aid our administration.
<br/><br/>
It has been a pleasure to work with Murray during his time with us.
<br/><br/>
Please do get in touch if I can be of any further assistance.

<h2>Coding Club</h2>
<p>When I left my primary school I wanted to give other children the experience that I had gained in the school Coding Club. This is why I helped out every Thursday until the end of Year 10 when the teacher who ran the club left the school. This time taught me many leadership qualities and has made me very resilient and patient due to teaching young children.</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<h3>Jack Petchey</h3>
When I was 15, I was awarded the Jack Petchey Award for my work in Scouts.
<h3>DofE Bronze</h3>
I am currently doing my DofE bronze.

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>CASA</h3>
I have had a day's work experience with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">CASA</a> at UCL. I learnt a lot about the working environment and the work that they do there.
