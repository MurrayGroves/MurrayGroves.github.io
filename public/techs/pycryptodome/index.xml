      <description>After making my Welcome To Nightvale Discord Bot, I was thinking about how complicated it was to create databases. It was with this thought that I decided to make a Python package to allow quick and easy integration of a user accounts system into any Python project. The package uses sha224 hashing for safe storage of passwords and AES ECB encryption for storage of account data.
Features: - Create a user account in one function call - Login a user with one function call - Add additional user data with one function call - Read additional user data with one function call</description>
