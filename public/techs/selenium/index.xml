      <description>I was given the CBIS education DIY car, the two ways of controlling were either via controller wired into the car or over Wi-Fi via a website with buttons. The wired controller was not practical as you had to follow the car around everywhere and the website was difficult to use due to having to press buttons with your mouse. To solve this problem, I made a program that takes inputs from an Xbox controller using the &amp;lsquo;inputs&amp;rsquo; library and mapped them to the different buttons on the website using the &amp;lsquo;selenium&amp;rsquo; library, this leads to a much more convenient driving experience and is much more ergonomic than either of the existing options.</description>
